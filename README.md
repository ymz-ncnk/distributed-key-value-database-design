# distributed-key-value-database-design
Here you can find a design of a distributed key-value database that uses the 
[Sync consensus algorithm](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/sync-consensus-algorithm),
writes data in one-phase and processes each read request by a single node.
But that's not all, we can go further and develop a 
[full-featured database](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/distributed-database-of-aggregates-design) 
using this concept.

# distributed-key-value-database-design
Here you can find a design of a distributed key-value database that uses the 
[Sync consensus algorithm](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/sync-consensus-algorithm).

There is also a [full-featured database](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/distributed-database-of-aggregates-design)
built on the basis of this concept.

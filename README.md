# distributed-key-value-database-design
Here you can find a design of a distributed key-value database that uses the 
[Sync consensus algorithm](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/sync-consensus-algorithm).

On the basis of such a key-value database, we can build a more complex system 
like [this one](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/distributed-database-of-aggregates-design).

# distributed-key-value-database-design
Here you can find a design of a distributed key-value database that uses the 
[Sync consensus algorithm](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/sync-consensus-algorithm).
But that's not all, we can go further and develop a 
[fully functional database]((https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/distributed-database-of-aggregates-design)) 
using this concept.

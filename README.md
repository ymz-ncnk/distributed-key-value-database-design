# distributed-key-value-database-design
Here you can find a design of a fast distributed key-value database that uses the 
[Sync consensus algorithm](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/sync-consensus-algorithm).

On the basis of such a key-value database, we can build a more complex [system](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/distributed-database-of-aggregates-design)
that, in addition to storing data, offers search and processing capabilities, 
supports distributed transactions, and can scale to multiple regions.

Work on this project is still ongoing.

# distributed-key-value-database-design
Here you can find a design of the distributed key-value database that uses the 
[Sync consensus algorithm](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/sync-consensus-algorithm). 
With this concept, we can try to design a full-featured distributed database like 
[this](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/distributed-database-of-aggregates-design).
